This is a pure luajit binding for sockets on linux, macos and windows with no binary dependencies. It slightly resembles luasocket's core module, but it's a bit more low level and tries to follow the bsd socket api. It aims to just be a single file that's easy to copy paste. :)

There is an additional ljtls.lua binding for various OS specific TLS implementations. While it seems to be working on the surface, the code is 80% AI slop. It also only implements client use. It serves as a working starting point at least for something more serious.
